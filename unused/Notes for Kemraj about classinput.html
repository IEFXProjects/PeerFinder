when the python program is created for managing everybody's CRN codes, i referenced classinput.py.  you can name it whatever you want but change it here as well


I made 18CRN inputs because the maximum credits a person can take is 18... so if they took 18 1credit hour classes we would have them covered. if we could figure out a way to have an add button with an infinite number of classes that may work better since lecture and discussion classes have different CRN codes... Kemraj I think that is probably python so your department
