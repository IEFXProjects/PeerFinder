These are the names that I used in the HTML file that the python program needs to replace for each user.

their bio= b_i_o
profile picture= Profile_pic
first name= F_name
Middle name= M_name
Last name= L_name
Classes=Class1, Class2...
class time= time1, time2...
professor= professor1, professor2...
class location= location1, location2...

(note: the class schedule is waiting for Mylon to code the Java script, but as long as he uses these codes you should be able to start coding the program.)
